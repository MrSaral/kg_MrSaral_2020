# kg_MrSaral_2020

This repo is my submission to the online assessment challenge presented by Kargo Engineering team as part of their recruitment drive for Summmer Internships 2020.

The following files are attached in this repo,
1) main.py -  Python file containing the code
2) MIT open license agreement
3) Readme file

Instructions to run the code,
1) download the file, open terminal to run python or any python client
2) run by using the command - python main.py arg1 arg2
Remember arg1 and arg2 are the two arguments passed to the program.

The time complexity of the code is bigO(N) where N is the length of the first string.


Please feel free to email me or message me to ask questions regarding this code. I have tried to include as much comments as possible. Thank you :)
